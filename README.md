## MTP3 Feature 
Larger information blocks can be accommodated directly by
   M3UA/SCTP, without the need for an upper layer segmentation/
   re-assembly procedure as specified in recent SCCP or ISUP versions.
   However, in the context of an SG, the maximum 272-octet block size
   must be followed when interworking to a SS7 network that does not
   support the transfer of larger information blocks to the final
   destination.
